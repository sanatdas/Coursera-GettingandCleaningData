# Coursera-GettingandCleaningData
‚ÄùGetting and Cleaning Data" - course Project

Overview:

This repository includes a single script, run_analysis.R, that merges data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set project at the UCI Machine Learning Repository to produce averages values per user per activity for the dataset's mean and standard deviation features. Refer to the included codebook.md for more information

Usage:

Set the working directory to the folder containing the activity recognition dataset. Run the script run_analysis.R. The script produces a single output file, tidy_data.txt in the current directory, that contains the merged and transformed data.

You can run the scripts using: source("run_analysis.R")
